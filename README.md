## üèÅ Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need to have **Node.js** (version 18.x or later), **npm**, and **Git LFS** installed on your system.

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
-   [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.com/)

### Installation & Setup

Follow these simple steps to get the development environment running:

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/wakkycodes/TrackDemons.git](https://github.com/wakkycodes/TrackDemons.git)
    ```

2.  **Retrieve LFS objects (models, textures, etc.)**
    ```sh
    git lfs install
    git lfs pull
    ```
    > Without this step, you may see placeholder text files instead of the actual game assets.

3.  **Navigate to the project directory**
    ```sh
    cd trackdemons
    ```

4.  **Install dependencies**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```
    > **Note on `npm ci`**: While you mentioned `npm ci`, it's best to use `npm install` for local development. `npm ci` is mainly for automated environments (like GitHub Actions) to ensure a clean, exact install from the `package-lock.json` file.

5.  **Run the development server**
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```
    Your project should now be running on `http://localhost:5173` (or the next available port).

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

This project is built with a modern, high-performance tech stack:

-   **[React](https://reactjs.org/):** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
-   **[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/):** A next-generation frontend tooling that provides a faster and leaner development experience.
-   **[Three.js](https://threejs.org/):** The core 3D library for creating and displaying animated 3D graphics in a web browser.
-   **[React Three Fiber](https://docs.pmnd.rs/react-three-fiber):** A React renderer for Three.js, making it easy to build 3D scenes declaratively.
-   **[React Three Cannon](https://docs.pmnd.rs/react-three-cannon):** Physics bindings for React Three Fiber, enabling realistic object interactions.
-   **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/):** A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
